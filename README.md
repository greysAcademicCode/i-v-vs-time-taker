i-v-vs-time-taker
=================

This project contains a graphical user interface for controlling a keithley 2400 sourcemeter, useful for investigating transient events in I-V sweeps of solar cells. This tool can produce data files that contain current and voltage measurements as a function of time sampled at ~200Hz (as fast as I can currently get the Keithley to go) during an I-V sweep measaurement. Such 'high speed' data sampling can be used to intelligently advance the sweep once a steady state has been reached at each point in the sweep. This prevents over-estimation of the current in solar cells with large RC constants such as certian perovskite cell architectures.

Two other projects accompany this project:
- batch-i-v-analysis
 - a GUI that can plot the current and voltage verses time data files generated here. Also does fully automated curve fitting and analysis on regular i vs v data sets
- hyst-analysis
 - a MATLAB script that does much more in depth analysis of the current and voltage verses time data files generated here

### Files here
---
- **i-v-vs-time-taker.py**
 - Main python script. Run this to use the tool. You can edit the code in this file directly using your favorite python editor.
- **ivSweeper.ui**
 - Contains user interface design for main window, edit with Qt Designer (I used version 4.8.5)
- **ivSweeperUI.py**
 - Do not edit this file directly. Instead generate it from ivSweeper.ui by issuing:  
`pyuic4 -o ivSweeperUI.py ivSweeper.ui`
- **gpib.py**
 - Contains thread-safe gpib interface for communication with the sourcemeter
